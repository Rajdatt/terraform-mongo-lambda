DevOps Mongo Lambda
ðŸš€ A serverless Node.js application running on AWS Lambda that connects to MongoDB hosted in a private VPC using ECS Fargate (Docker). This project demonstrates infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles with Terraform, ensuring a secure, scalable, and automated deployment process.

Features:
âœ… Serverless Architecture â€“ AWS Lambda for API execution
âœ… MongoDB in Private VPC â€“ Hosted on ECS Fargate (Docker)
âœ… Secure Connectivity â€“ Uses VPC Endpoints for isolated access
âœ… DevOps-Driven Deployment â€“ Automates setup with Terraform
âœ… CI/CD Ready â€“ Can be integrated with GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline

Tech Stack:
AWS Lambda (Node.js)
MongoDB (Docker on ECS Fargate)
Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
Amazon VPC (Private Networking)

Getting Started:
Clone the repository
Deploy infrastructure using Terraform
Invoke Lambda to query MongoDB
Extend with CI/CD for automated deployments
